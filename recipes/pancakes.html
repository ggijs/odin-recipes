    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour </li>
        <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>⅓ cup wheat germ </li>
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>5 ⅓ tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
        <li>2 ½ cups buttermilk </li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, white flour, wheat germ or oats, 
            baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the flour-mixture. Mix until the mixture has a sand-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the liquids are fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the batter onto the surface to form 
            4 inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes.</li>
