        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, white flour, wheat germ or oats, 
            baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the flour-mixture. Mix until the mixture has a sand-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the liquids are fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the batter onto the surface to form 
            4 inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes.</li>
